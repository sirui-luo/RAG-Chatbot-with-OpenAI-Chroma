# RAG Chatbot Demo with Azure OpenAI & Chroma — Alice in Wonderland

This project demonstrates a small-scale implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using Azure OpenAI, LangChain, and ChromaDB. The chatbot is powered by GPT-4o and responds to user queries based solely on information retrieved from a reference document — *Alice in Wonderland*.

> **Note**: This is a demo project using Alice in Wonderland as a reference. You can easily adapt it to any other corpus (e.g., manuals, documentation, PDFs) by replacing the markdown files in `data/books/`.
